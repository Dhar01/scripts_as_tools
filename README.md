# Scripts as tools

I wrote some scripts to automate some work I've done over and over. Thought, it would be superb if I try to make them universal for everyone, at least a little. Thus, this repository exists. You can say, I've done this for me.

And you're right.

Anyway, I'm really sorry I can't provide a list of the scripts/tools available on this repo. I'm too lazy for that. Maybe I will try to automate this too.

BTW, I'm a very bad coder. Any suggestions/improvements will be appreciated.

See ya.
